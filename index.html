        <p>My hobby is reading interesting books in my free time. Whenever I get home from school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 10 years old and in 5th grade. I know that reading is a very good habit which can make me smart. Reading is very fun. Reading is a great source of entertainment and knowledge.</p>
